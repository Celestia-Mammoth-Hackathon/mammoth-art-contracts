   - Update technical documentation when changing functionality
   - Include inline comments for complex logic

3. **Gas Optimization**
   - Consider gas costs in your implementation
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Optimize loops and storage usage

4. **Security**
   - Follow security best practices
   - Consider reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and other common vulnerabilities
